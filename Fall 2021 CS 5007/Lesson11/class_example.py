# ClassName:

# Constructor
# Instance variables to be defined in constructor

class MyClass:
    pass


my_object = MyClass()  # this calls the default constructor with no attributes or methods
# It will instantiate an object of "MyClass"
# this is why you need to define your own constructor for every single class

# __init__ method should be used

# Code should be consistent with UML class diagram


# Self = The object instance

# Self points to the memory where the object is stored
